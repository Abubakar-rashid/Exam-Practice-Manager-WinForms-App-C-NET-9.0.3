# Exam-Practice-Manager-WinForms-App-C#.NET-9.0.3
Hey there! 👋 This is a desktop app I built using C# with .NET SDK 9 and WinForms as part of a Software Testing &amp; Quality course. It's a fully functional exam and question practice system for both lecturers and students, designed to make assessment and preparation smoother.
